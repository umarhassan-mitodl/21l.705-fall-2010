  "course_description": "Global exploration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries radically changed Western science, orienting philosophies of natural history to more focused fields like comparative anatomy, botany, and geology. In the United States, European scientific advances and home-grown ventures like the Wilkes Exploring Expedition to Antarctica and the Pacific inspired new endeavors in cartography, ethnography, zoology, and evolutionary theory, replacing rigid models of thought and classification with more fluid and active systems. They inspired literary authors as well. This class will examine some of the most remarkable of these authors\u2014Herman Melville (_Moby-Dick_ and \"The Encantadas\"), Henry David Thoreau (_Walden_), Sarah Orne Jewett (_Country of the Pointed Firs_), Edith Wharton (_House of Mirth_), Toni Morrison (_A Mercy_), among others\u2014in terms of the subjects and methods they adopted, imaginatively and often critically, from the natural sciences.\n",
